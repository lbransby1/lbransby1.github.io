## About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science and Math student with a passion for data science, machine learning, and martial arts.

Currently working on:
- A UFC fight outcome predictor using ensemble models
- An ELO ranking system for MMA fighters
- Performance analysis with round-by-round fight stats

I also practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and enjoy exploring AI research.
