title: About Me

I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Computer Science, and Iâ€™m now studying Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL.

For my final year project, I built a machine learning model to predict Mixed Martial Arts fight outcomes, teaching myself ML from scratch in the process. [Read more about it here](./blog/dissertation.md)

I quickly became fascinated by the power of machine learning to tackle complex, unpredictable problems. MMA is a chaotic sport with many variables, and my goal is to bring insight and structure to that chaos using AI.

This experience sparked a genuine passion for applied machine learning, which I now aim to pursue professionally.
